# Face Recognition API

A FastAPI-based application that provides face recognition capabilities, including training face models, detecting faces in images, and real-time face recognition through a webcam.

## Features

- **Face Registration**: Upload face images with names to train the recognition model
- **Face Detection**: Detect and identify faces in uploaded images
- **Real-time Recognition**: Detect and identify faces in real-time using a webcam
- **Model Management**: View and delete trained face models

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-api.git
   cd face-recognition-api
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn face_recognition numpy pillow python-multipart jinja2
   ```

   Note: The `face_recognition` library requires `dlib` which may need additional system dependencies. On some systems, you might need to install cmake and other build tools.

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python facedetection/app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Web Interface
- `GET /`: Main web interface for interacting with the application

### API Endpoints
- `POST /upload-training-face/`: Register a new face
- `POST /detect-face/`: Detect faces in an uploaded image
- `GET /known-faces/`: Get a list of all registered face names
- `DELETE /known-faces/{name}`: Delete a registered face by name
- `WebSocket /ws/detect-face-realtime/`: Real-time face detection from webcam

## Technical Details

- The application uses the `face_recognition` library, which is built on top of dlib
- Face encodings are generated from images and stored in a pickle file
- Face matching uses a tolerance of 0.6 (lower values are more strict)
- Confidence scores are calculated as (1 - face_distance)

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with the `face_recognition` library, ensure you have the required system dependencies for dlib
- For webcam access issues, ensure your browser has permission to access your camera
- The application creates necessary directories on startup, but if you encounter permission issues, create them manually

If you're using an Apple M1/M2 MacBook or other Apple silicon device, you'll need to take some additional steps for the face_recognition library to work properly:

1. Install Homebrew if you don't have it already:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Install CMake and other dependencies:
   ```bash
   brew install cmake
   brew install openblas
   brew install python
   ```

3. You may also need to set some environment variables:
   ```bash
   export OPENBLAS=$(brew --prefix openblas)
   export CFLAGS="-I$OPENBLAS/include"
   export LDFLAGS="-L$OPENBLAS/lib"
   ```

4. Install dlib separately (with specific options for Apple silicon):
   ```bash
   pip install dlib
   ```

5. Then install the remaining dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn face_recognition numpy pillow python-multipart jinja2
   ```

If you encounter any issues, you might need to install dlib from source with specific compilation options for Apple silicon. Reference the [dlib documentation](https://github.com/davisking/dlib) for more details.
